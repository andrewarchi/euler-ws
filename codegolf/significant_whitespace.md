# Whitespace, 68 bytes, [by Ephphatha](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/103182/significant-whitespace-cops/123333#123333)

- 68 bytes, 21 tabs: `LSSLSSTLSLSTLTSTTTSSSTSTSLTSSTSLSLTSLSSSTSTTSLTSSTLTSLSSLTTTTLSSLSLL`
- 71 bytes, 21 tabs: `LSSLSSLTLTSSSLTTTSSSTSTSLTSSTLTSLSSLTTTSSSTSSSSSLTSSTLTSLSSLTTTTLSSLSLL`
- 72 bytes, 21 tabs: `LSSLSSSTTTTTTLSLSTLTSTTTSLSSSSTSTSLTSSTLTSLSLSSSSTSSSSSLTSSTLTSLTLSSLSLL`
- 65 bytes, 15 tabs (too short): `LSSLSSLSLSTLTSTTTSLSSSSTSTSLTSSTLTSLSLSSSSTSSSSSLTSSTLTSLTLSSLSLL`

Since Whitespace only consists of space, tab, and LF characters (here annotated
as `S`, `T`, and `L`), the entire program needs to be reconstructed, with the
only constraint being that it have exactly 21 tabs to match the cops submission.

I start with a working program, but it's too short and needs 6 more tabs. It
beats the target by 9 bytes, so I could have submitted this as another cop
program, but I don't think it's interesting enough to warrant a second
Whitespace answer.

```wsa
# 65 bytes, 15 tabs
loop:                        # LSSL
    0 dup readc retrieve     # SSL SLS TLTS TTT
    dup 10 - jz loop         # SLS SSSTSTSL TSST LTSL
    dup 32 - jz loop         # SLS SSSTSSSSSL TSST LTSL
    printc                   # TLSS
    jmp loop                 # LSLL
```

The simplest way to add more tabs would be to use 63 (STTTTTT) as the address
for reading characters instead of 0 (empty).

```wsa
# 72 bytes, 21 tabs
loop:                        # LSSL
    63 dup readc retrieve    # SSSTTTTTTL SLS TLTS TTT
    â€¦
```

That only adds bytes, though. If we `retrieve` before every usage, we can
eliminate three `dup`s, which have no tabs (SLS). (This is also the only of
these versions without a stack memory leak.)

```wsa
# 71 bytes, 21 tabs
loop:                        # LSSL
    0 readc                  # SSL TLTS
    0 retrieve 10 - jz loop  # SSL TTT SSSTSTSL TSST LTSL
    0 retrieve 32 - jz loop  # SSL TTT SSSTSSSSSL TSST LTSL
    0 retrieve printc        # SSL TTT TLSS
    jmp loop                 # LSLL
```

We can do better. If we compound the subtractions, 32 (STSSSSS) can be replaced
with 22 (STSTTS), which gains 2 tabs and saves 1 byte. Then, the second branch
doesn't `dup` and the print would obtain an unmodified value with `0 retrieve`,
which gains 3 tabs and adds 3 bytes. For the last tab, a negative sign is added
to one of the zeros.

```wsa
# 68 bytes, 21 tabs
loop:                        # LSSL
    -0 dup readc retrieve    # SSTL SLS TLTS TTT
    10 - dup jz loop         # SSSTSTSL TSST SLS LTSL
    22 - jz loop             # SSSTSTTSL TSST LTSL
    0 retrieve printc        # SSL TTT TLSS
    jmp loop                 # LSLL
```

These programs require an implementation, that allows the sign to be omitted for
zero, so will not work with the reference interpreter, which TIO uses.
